# A unused but implemented client option allows for remotely-exploitable memory leaks that could compromise private keys!
# OpenSSH clients from 5.4 to 7.1 are affected. See CVE-2016-0778, CVE-2016-0777, and http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.1p2 for more information.

# Opportunistically use ControlMaster multiplexing for *all* hosts.
# No downsides worth mentioning.

	ControlMaster auto
	ControlPersist yes
	ControlPath ~/.ssh/tmp/%r@%h:%p.sock
	#@@@ Alternative ControlPath: instead of plaintext variables, use a hash of them.
	# Good if you like obfuscation, or hit path length limits due to giant hostnames/usernames.
	## Only works in OpenSSH >= 6.7
