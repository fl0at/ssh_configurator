### Remember, ssh_config uses the *first* specified option for a matching host field.
#   So it's best to have generally-applicable options at the end, lest you override host-specific options...

# A default-enabled client option, for which server support was never implemented, allows for remotely-exploitable memory leaks that could compromise private keys!
# OpenSSH clients from 5.4 to 7.1 are affected. See CVE-2016-0778, CVE-2016-0777, and http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.1p2 for more information.
